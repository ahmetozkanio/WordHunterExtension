# WordHunter Extension

ðŸ“š **WordHunter** is a powerful browser extension that combines word collection and spaced repetition learning techniques to help you master new vocabulary effectively. Whether you're learning a new language or expanding your vocabulary, WordHunter provides a seamless experience for collecting words from any website and learning them through scientifically proven spaced repetition intervals.

## Core Features

- **Smart Word Collection**: Easily collect words from any website while browsing
- **Spaced Repetition System**: Scientifically optimized review intervals for maximum retention
- **Learning Progress Tracking**: 7-level learning system with automatic review scheduling
- **Flexible Import/Export**: Support for CSV, JSON, and TXT formats
- **Interactive Learning Tools**: 
  - Text-to-speech pronunciation
  - One-click Google Translate integration
  - Word encounter tracking
  - Progress visualization

## Learning System

WordHunter implements a sophisticated spaced repetition algorithm with 7 progressive learning levels:

- **Level 0**: New words awaiting study
- **Level 1**: Initial learning (Review today)
- **Level 2**: Early retention (Review tomorrow)
- **Level 3**: Basic mastery (Review in 4 days)
- **Level 4**: Intermediate mastery (Review in 7 days)
- **Level 5**: Advanced retention (Review in 14 days)
- **Level 6**: Complete mastery (Review in 30 days)

The system automatically adjusts review intervals based on your performance, ensuring optimal learning efficiency. If you fail to recall a word during its scheduled review, the system will automatically decrease its level, requiring more frequent reviews until mastery is achieved. This adaptive approach increases the repetition count for challenging words, reinforcing your memory and improving long-term retention.
